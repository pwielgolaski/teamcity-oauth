You need to specify your client id and client secret.
Also you need to specific scope, `user` is fine for github, 'account' for bitbucket.

If you dont choose "Allow creating new users on the first login" only users that already exists in Teamcity can login.
It means that you need account with the same name as user login name in oauth.

You can decide if you want to hide user/password form on login screen (worth leaving unchecked when you test it).

You can consider to disable also "Allow user registration from the login page" in "Built-in" module.

Save and test out.

Login at your Teamcity host.
